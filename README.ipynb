# Student Academic Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes various factors that influence student academic performance. The goal is to understand what impacts student success by examining relationships between grades and different aspects of students' lives and backgrounds.

## Key Research Questions
1. How do grades progress throughout the academic period? (G1 → G2 → G3)
2. What is the impact of attendance on final grades?
3. How does study time correlate with academic performance?
4. Is there any relationship between parental education levels and student achievement?
5. Are there gender-based differences in academic performance?
6. What role do lifestyle factors play in academic success?

## Data Analysis Includes
- Grade progression patterns and correlations between different grading periods
- Demographic influences on academic performance
- Impact of study habits and attendance
- Relationship between family background (parental education) and student achievement
- Analysis of various lifestyle factors and their effect on grades

## Key Findings and Results

### Grade Progression
- Strong correlation between period grades (G1, G2) and final grades (G3)
- Second period grades (G2) are stronger predictors of final performance than first period grades (G1)
- Clear progression patterns identified that could help with early intervention strategies

### Attendance Impact
- Negative correlation between number of absences and final grades
- Each absence corresponds to a measurable decrease in expected final grade
- Attendance monitoring could be a key factor in improving student outcomes

### Study Time Influence
- Increased study time generally correlates with improved academic performance
- Diminishing returns observed past certain thresholds of study hours
- Optimal study time patterns identified for maximizing academic achievement

### Parental Education Effects
- Higher levels of parental education (especially maternal) positively correlate with student grades
- Students with highly educated parents show less grade variance, indicating more consistent performance
- Potential need for additional support for students from less educated family backgrounds

### Gender Analysis
- Identified specific performance patterns across genders in the student population
- Gender-based differences in study habits and their effectiveness
- Results provide insights for targeted academic support strategies

### Lifestyle Factors
- Alcohol consumption shows negative correlation with academic performance
- Social activities and free time usage patterns impact grades
- Data suggests balance between academic and social life is important for optimal performance

## Achievements
- Created comprehensive analytical framework for understanding student performance factors
- Developed predictive insights for early identification of at-risk students
- Established evidence-based recommendations for improving academic outcomes
- Built visualization toolkit for educational performance analysis
- Identified key intervention points for maximizing student success

## Practical Applications
- Early warning system for identifying struggling students
- Evidence-based recommendations for student support services
- Data-driven insights for educational policy development
- Framework for ongoing educational performance monitoring

## Tools Used
- Python with data science libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Data visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Statistical analysis techniques
